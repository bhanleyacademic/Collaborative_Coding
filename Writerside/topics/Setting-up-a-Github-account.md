# Setting up a GitHub account

[GitHub](https://github.com)

## Intro
Git is an industry standard of version control and is used extensively between teams and individuals to be able to view past revisions of what went wrong. 
GitHub is a cloud based service that allows both public and private repositories so that you can share your code or sync it between your coding environments.
This is meant to serve as a basic cursory set up to an extremely deep and powerful tool.

## Setting up your account and repo
1. Create your account on GitHub with any e-mail that you would like.

7. You're all setup!

## Committing, Pushing, and Pulling 
1. If you are using the Jetbrains suite you can set up an automatic connection to the repo and just commit your changes every time. That info will be available on the [Managing GitHub through JetBrains programs](Managing-Github-through-JetBrains-programs.md) pages.
2. If you are coding with any other offline IDEs you can use GitHub desktop to sync to the folder that you are saving your files in and commit changes using that.
3. I urge you to explore your options using GitHub, but for now think of it as a cloud storage that syncs and shows your changes in code.
