# Using Writerside as a note system in math classes

## What is Writerside?
Writerside is a newer tool for JetBrains. Basically it allows you to create documentation in markdown or XML format and organize it more efficiently.
I am using Writerside to write all of this information.

## Why use it for math class?
I started using Writerside specifically for math classes because it support LaTeX in markdown format. This allows me to type out equations quickly and 
is extremely useful for having things formatted correctly.

## What is LaTeX?
LaTeX is a way of typing out mathematical equations and having them appear correctly. For example

``` 
\frac{\mu-\mu_0}{\sqrt{450}}
```
Shows up as
```tex 
\frac{\mu-\mu_0}{\sqrt{450}}
```

## Using it as math notes
In Writerside all you have to do is use
``` 
```tex
[Your LaTeX code]
` ``
```
to make equations appear like they do from your professor.

## Can I use it for other classes?
Absolutely, I use Writerside for all of my classes now as so that I can create notebooks and use the tools afterwards to generate a 
local website so that I can find what I need easily. Everything gets synced to my GitHub so that I will always have access to them.

Writerside also allows you to paste images from your clipboard into the document and saves the image for you making adding screenshots super easy.
