# Setting up Pycharm

## Before you begin
1. Install [Python](https://python.org)
2. Install [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)
3. Install PyCharm using JetBrains Toolbox

## Starting a New Project
1. After clicking "New Project" you will get to this screen, name the project whatever you want and choose a Python interpreter![pycharm-new-project.png](pycharm-new-project.png)
2. Go to File > New to open a menu that will allow you to create a Python file ![pycharm-file.png](pycharm-file.png)
3. Name the Python file whatever you want it to be and hit enter ![pycharm-name.png](pycharm-name.png)
4. If you have already set up GitHub it will ask if you want the file to be added to it. I suggest adding files as long as they do not contain sensitive information (API keys, passwords in plain text, etc.) ![pycharm-git-confirm.png](pycharm-git-confirm.png)
5. Start coding!

## Running your Python code
1. When you want to run your Python code just click the green triangle in the upper right of the screen. ![image.png](image.png)
2. This will bring up a console instance at the bottom of the screen that will show you the results of the run ![pycharm-run-results.png](pycharm-run-results.png)

## Setting up a Jupyter Notebook
If you like the way that Google Colaboratory works but would like to run it offline and locally you can use that instead.

2. Go to File > New but choose "Jupyter Notebook" instead. ![pycharm-jupyter.png](pycharm-jupyter.png)
2. This will create a Jupyter notebook locally that will start a Jupyter server to run your code in cells. ![pycharm-jupyter-file.png](pycharm-jupyter-file.png)
3. Clicking on the green arrow with a cursor in the corner will run only that cell. ![pycharm-jupyter-cell.png](pycharm-jupyter-cell.png)
4. Clicking the double green arrow will run all of your cells in order from top to bottom. ![pycharm-jupyter-all.png](pycharm-jupyter-all.png)
