# Setting Up Google Colaboratory

## Intro
Google Colab is a quick way to create a collaborative environment to work on Python projects or even just to work on your own.
Colab uses a notebook style coding process allowing you to use different cells to enter code so you can run snippets at a time to make sure that they work.

## Setting up the environment
1. Sign in to Google with either your personal google account or your school account.

2. Click on "+ New notebook"![colab-new-notebook.png](colab-new-notebook.png)
3. Click on the title (Should be something along the lines of Untitled0.ipynb) to rename it for your project ![colab-rename.png](colab-rename.png)
4. Click on "Share" to start adding your group ![colab-share.png](colab-share.png)
5. On the share screen either select your school (if applicable) or "Anyone with the link"![colab-access.png](colab-access.png)
6. **Alternative** You can also add members by e-mail instead of generating a link to share. ![colab-email-share.png](colab-email-share.png)
6. Make sure that you change role to "Editor" so that your group can all work on it at the same time ![colab-role.png](colab-role.png)
7. You're all setup! 

## Coding on Colab
1. You can start typing your Python code into the first cell to start working. ![colab-code.png](colab-code.png)
2. To run your code you can click the play button to the left to run that specific cell. The first run is going to take a while as the coding server starts up, but you will see any outputs below the cell that has been run.![colab-run-cell.png](colab-run-cell.png)
3. **Optional** When you open your notebook you can click on "Connect"/"Reconnect" to start the server right away. The server will shut down automatically after a few hours of inactivity. ![colab-start-server.png](colab-start-server.png)
4. While you can program completely in a single cell, you should break your code up into cells to allow you to debug in smaller snippets. Put your cursor above or below your current cell to find the "+ Code" button or use the one in the upper left. ![colab-code-cell.png](colab-code-cell.png)
5. **Optional** You can also use a text cell to make notes as well instead of putting comments into your code.![colab-text-cell.png](colab-text-cell.png)

## Recovering code
If you find that you or someone else in your group has accidentally deleted a block of code all is not lost! Just visit your revision history in File > Revision History 

![colab-revision-history.png](colab-revision-history.png)

You can choose different auto-saved times and review where the code was deleted to recover what was removed
