<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Intro</span>
<span class="s2">Google Colab is a quick way to create a collaborative environment to work on Python projects or even just to work on your own.</span>
<span class="s2">Colab uses a notebook style coding process allowing you to use different cells to enter code so you can run snippets at a time to make sure that they work.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Setting up the environment</span>
<span class="s0">1. </span><span class="s2">Sign in to Google with either your personal google account or your school account.</span>

<span class="s0">3. </span><span class="s2">Click on the title </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">Should be something along the lines of Untitled0.ipynb</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">to rename it for your project </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">colab-rename.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">colab-rename.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">4. </span><span class="s2">Click on </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">Share</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">to start adding your group </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">colab-share.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">colab-share.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">5. </span><span class="s2">On the share screen either select your school </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">if applicable</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">or </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">Anyone with the link</span><span class="s1">&quot;![</span><span class="s2">colab-access.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">colab-access.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Coding on Colab</span>
<span class="s0">1. </span><span class="s2">You can start typing your Python code into the first cell to start working. </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">colab-code.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">colab-code.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">2. </span><span class="s2">To run your code you can click the play button to the left to run that specific cell. The first run is going to take a while as the coding server starts up, but you will see any outputs below the cell that has been run.</span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">colab-run-cell.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">colab-run-cell.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">3. </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s2">Optional</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s2">When you open your notebook you can click on </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">Connect</span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">/</span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">Reconnect</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">to start the server right away. The server will shut down automatically after a few hours of inactivity. </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">colab-start-server.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">colab-start-server.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">4. </span><span class="s2">While you can program completely in a single cell, you should break your code up into cells to allow you to debug in smaller snippets. Put your cursor above or below your current cell to find the </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">+ Code</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">button or use the one in the upper left. </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">colab-code-cell.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">colab-code-cell.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">5. </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s2">Optional</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s2">You can also use a text cell to make notes as well instead of putting comments into your code.</span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">colab-text-cell.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">colab-text-cell.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Recovering code</span>
<span class="s2">If you find that you or someone else in your group has accidentally deleted a block of code all is not lost</span><span class="s1">! </span><span class="s2">Just visit your revision history in File </span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s2">Revision History </span>

<span class="s2">You can choose different auto-saved times and review where the code was deleted to recover what was removed </span>
