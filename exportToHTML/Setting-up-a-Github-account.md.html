<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Intro</span>
<span class="s2">Git is an industry standard of version control and is used extensively between teams and individuals to be able to view past revisions of what went wrong. </span>
<span class="s2">Github is a cloud based service that allows both public and private repositories so that you can share your code or sync it between your coding environments.</span>
<span class="s2">This is meant to serve as a basic cursory set up to an extremely deep and powerful tool.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Setting up your account and repo</span>
<span class="s0">1. </span><span class="s2">Create your account on Github with any e-mail that you would like.</span>
   <span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">github-signup.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">github-signup.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">2. </span><span class="s2">Click on </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">New</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">to create a new repository </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">github-new-repo.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">github-new-repo.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">3. </span><span class="s2">Fill in the Repository Name and choose Private. </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">github-repo-config.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">github-repo-config.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">4. </span><span class="s2">Click on </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">Invite collaborators</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">to start adding your group </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">github-invite.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">github-invite.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">7. </span><span class="s2">You're all setup</span><span class="s1">!</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Committing, Pushing, and Pulling </span>
<span class="s0">1. </span><span class="s2">If you are using the Jetbrains suite you can set up an automatic connection to the repo and just commit your changes every time. That info will be available on the </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Managing Github through JetBrains programs</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">Managing-Github-through-JetBrains-programs.md</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">pages.</span>
<span class="s0">2. </span><span class="s2">If you are coding with any other offline IDEs you can use Github desktop to sync to the folder that you are saving your files in and commit changes using that.</span>
<span class="s0">3. </span><span class="s2">I urge you to explore your options using Github, but for now think of it as a cloud storage that syncs and shows your changes in code.</span></pre>
